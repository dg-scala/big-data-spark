Your overall score for this assignment is 0.00 out of 10.00


We were not able to compile our tests, and therefore we could not correct your submission.

The most likely reason for this problem is that your submitted code uses different names
for methods, classes, objects or different types than expected.

In principle, this can only arise if you changed some names or types in the code that we
provide, for instance a method name or a parameter type.

To diagnose your problem, perform the following steps:
 - Run the tests that we provide with our hand-out. These tests verify that all names and
   types are correct. In case these tests pass, but you still see this message, please post
   a report on the forums [1].
 - Take a careful look at the error messages from the Scala compiler below. They should give
   you a hint where your code has an unexpected shape.

If you cannot find a solution, ask for help on the discussion forums on the course website.
